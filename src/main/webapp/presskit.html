    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>The Knight of Trash are commin' at ya straight outta Seattle, WA. These guys got together in early 2016 with a shared love of the Milkshakes, 90's garage rock and all that influenced the greats that came before them. They started with a full set of classic Milkshakes songs and have written some great originals along the way. That band consists of two wily veterans of the Seattle (and West Coast) garage rock scene to steer the ship and two relative new comers that bring a metric ton of energy and personality. The mixture has produced up a high energy live show and solid original songs with a Medway Delta vibe and executed with a Seattle twist. Yeah sure, you've heard all this shit a thousand times before but the proof is in the show! Come on down and you'll see. Who comes to see The Knights of Trash? Chicks do. What do chicks do at a Knights of Trash show? They dance.  Where can you see The Knights of Trash? You can see them in Seattle, Portland, Wenatchee, Sacramento, San Francisco, Oakland and wherever else the good shit is going down. What else do you need to know? Put that in your iPad and smoke it!</p>

	<p><b>Zack Static</b><br>
	A child of the 90's garage revolution and the official leader of the Sect. Zack started the Statics way back in 1992 after buying a Supercharger record. He learned 3 cords, wrote some songs about hamburgers, quitting his job and girls that own't call him back and made a bunch of cool records. He's been in several less than memorable bands long the way but finally hit pay dirt once again with The Knights Of Trash. And it only took 20 years!</p>

	<p><b>Jamie Jaspers</b><br>
	Another long time rock and roll solider. Jamie had been holing down the bass for The Primate 5 and Eastern Washington punk legends Moral Crux for as long as I can remember. Jamie has been working it on out on bass for more Seattle bands than I could possibly list here. Jamie is a bass player of the highest order. He's doesn't play guitar, he plays bass and he looks good doing it!</p>

	<p><b>Robby Splinter</b><br>
 	Robby comes to us from Gig Harbor, WA. Rob doesn't have a long pedigree in the grange rock scene but they guy brings personality, screaming vocals and a flair for chaos in a live setting. You'd think he's been honing his craft for years but that's thing, Robby doesn't think, he just does it and he does it well! He's also the proud father of two, two Fender Jazzmasters that is!</p>

	<p><b>Michael G. Waugh</b><br>
	Straight out of Temecula! Where in the hell did we find this guy? Do you know how hard it is to find the next Bruce Brad? Well we found him and you can keep your hands off. Mike is the motor that drives bus and kid's got a motor. Mike's gonna keep the groove and keep the groove movin' all night long. He's also into tentacles, yeah that's right, I said tentacles. Just ask him at the next show.  </p>
